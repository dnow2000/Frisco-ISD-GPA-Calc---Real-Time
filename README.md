# Frisco-ISD-GPA-Calc---Real-Time
Frisco ISD calculates high school student GPAs at the end of each semester (December and June).

Many student would like the option to be able to see their GPA in real time without having to manually do calculation by hand

Unfortunately for some students the mobile apps on both Android and iOS do not show accurate real time GPAs.

This project is designed to perform the correct calculations on student data from the Home Access Center.
